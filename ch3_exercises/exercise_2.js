/*
We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

Zero is even.

One is odd.

For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

// Your code here.

function isEven(number){
    if (number == 0 ){
        return true
    }else if (number == 1) {
        return false
    }else{
        return number > 0 ? isEven(number - 2) : isEven(number + 2)
    }
};


console.log(isEven(50));
// → true
console.log(isEven(75));
// → false
console.log(isEven(-1));
// → ??
